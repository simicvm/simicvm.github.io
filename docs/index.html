<p>I build AI-powered products and explore new ways to utilize artificial intelligence to make a positive impact.</p>
<p>My primary interests are human cognition, artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer simulation.</p>
<p>You can find some of my writing on these subjects <a href="{{ site.github.url }}{{ 'writing.html' }}">here</a> or on <a href="https://medium.com/@simicvm">Medium</a>.</p>
<p>I currently live in Tokyo, where I serve as a CTO of <a href="https://ascent.ai">Ascent Robotics</a> and occasionally organize <a href="https://www.meetup.com/robotics-x-tokyo/">Robotics</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nftxtokyo/">NFT</a> meetups.</p>
